Middleman-Skeleton
==================

This is a port of the [Skeleton Responsive framework](https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton) for use with Middleman, HAML, and Sass.

**Usage

1. Clone this directory.
2. Have Sass watch the CSS files by running `sass --watch base.sass:base.css layout.sass:layout.css skeleton.sass:skeleton.css`
3. If you haven't already, run `gem install middleman` to install Middleman and all its dependencies.
4. There is no need to run `middleman init`, because the gemfile is already in this directory
5. Run `middleman server` and go to `localhost:4567`
6. Enjoy.
